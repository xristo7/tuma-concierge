# Tuma Concierge

Uganda boda shopping concierge — customers post shopping lists; verified riders buy and deliver.

## Stack (staging, free-tier)

- **Monorepo** `xristo7/tuma-concierge`
- **Apps:** `apps/customer`, `apps/rider`, `apps/admin`, `apps/restaurant`, `apps/merchant`, and `apps/web` (Next.js App Router → **Cloudflare Workers** via OpenNext)
- **API:** `apps/api` (Hono → **Cloudflare Worker**); `workers/api` is an unrelated legacy scaffold — leave alone
- **DB:** Cloudflare D1 (`tuma-api`), bound natively to the API Worker. Turso backs local dev only.
- **Shared:** `packages/shared` (`@tuma/shared`)

See **[infra/CLOUDFLARE.md](./infra/CLOUDFLARE.md)** for deploy commands, required secrets, and
known gotchas. Render (`render.yaml`) is kept for reference/rollback but is no longer the active
deploy target — see **[FRONTEND.md](./FRONTEND.md)**.
