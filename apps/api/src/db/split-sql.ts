/**
 * Splits a migration file into individual statements.
 *
 * A plain `sql.split(";")` also splits on semicolons inside comments and
 * string literals, which produces fragments that aren't valid SQL. The
 * migration files used to carry a warning telling authors never to write a
 * semicolon in a comment — a rule that was quietly broken twice anyway, in
 * ordinary prose like "nothing changes until they do; ...". Understanding
 * quotes and comments is a few lines of code and removes the rule entirely.
 *
 * Comments are dropped rather than passed through: the database has no use
 * for them, and dropping them keeps the logged statement count honest.
