 * this once at Fund time (to know what to actually collect) and persists
 * the result to order_fees so Settle later withholds the rider's cut
 * without needing to recompute against settings that may have changed in
 * between.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded: float-rail orders (no money ever passes through
 * Tuma to take a cut of) and, for the processing fee specifically,
 * wallet-funded orders (no external payment rail actually processed
 * anything). See computeCheckoutFees' `payingWithWallet` param.
