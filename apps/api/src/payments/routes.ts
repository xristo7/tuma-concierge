 * Two rules here, and both matter:
 *
 * 1. **The caller has to prove it's Yo!.** The callback URL you register
 *    with them carries a secret (`?token=…`, or an `X-Tuma-Callback-Token`
 *    header), and anything without it is refused. Without this the endpoint
 *    is an open door for anyone who wants to move payments around or just
 *    flood the logs.
 *
 * 2. **The body is a hint, never the truth.** Even a correctly
 *    authenticated payload only tells us *which* transaction changed — the
 *    new status is then read back from Yo!'s own API. So a forged or
 *    replayed callback can at worst make us re-check a payment we already
 *    know about, which is harmless.
