# Cloudflare (primary staging host)

All three services now run on Cloudflare Workers. Render config (`render.yaml`) is kept
for reference/rollback but is no longer the active deploy target.

| Service | Type | URL |
|---|---|---|
| `tuma-api` | Worker (Hono) | https://tuma-api.doxalight-inc.workers.dev |
| `tuma-customer` | Worker (Next.js via OpenNext) | https://tuma-customer.doxalight-inc.workers.dev |
| `tuma-rider` | Worker (Next.js via OpenNext) | https://tuma-rider.doxalight-inc.workers.dev |

Database is unchanged: Turso (libsql), reached over HTTP from the Worker.

## Requirements

- **Node ≥ 22** for `wrangler` v4 (the OpenNext Cloudflare adapter requires it). If your
  default Node is older, point `PATH` at a Node 22 install for deploy commands only —
  the build step (`opennextjs-cloudflare build`) works fine on older Node.
- `wrangler` authenticated (`wrangler login` or an API token in `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).

## Deploy

```bash
# API (Hono → Worker)
pnpm --filter api deploy          # wrangler deploy

# Customer / Rider (Next.js → Worker via OpenNext)
pnpm --filter customer deploy     # opennextjs-cloudflare build && wrangler deploy
pnpm --filter rider deploy
```

`autoDeploy`-style CI isn't wired up yet — deploys are manual (`wrangler deploy`) until a
GitHub Actions workflow is added.

## Config

- `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` — `vars` for CORS origins, MoMo sandbox settings. Secrets
  (`JWT_SECRET`, `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, MoMo credentials) are set via
  `wrangler secret put <NAME>` — never committed, never put in `vars`.
- `apps/customer/wrangler.jsonc`, `apps/rider/wrangler.jsonc` — static assets binding +
  `NEXT_PRIVATE_MINIMAL_MODE=1` (see gotcha below). `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is baked in at
  **build** time via `.env.production` in each app (safe to commit — it's a public value).

### Required secrets (not yet set — see below)

```bash
cd apps/api
wrangler secret put TURSO_DATABASE_URL
wrangler secret put TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
# JWT_SECRET already set (generated during initial deploy)

# Optional, only needed to test MoMo escrow funding/payout:
wrangler secret put MOMO_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY
wrangler secret put MOMO_API_USER
wrangler secret put MOMO_API_KEY
```

Use the **same** Turso staging credentials already configured on the old Render
`tuma-api-staging` service (Render dashboard → Environment). Until these are set, every
DB-backed endpoint (auth, orders, etc.) returns a clean 500 — confirmed working as
designed, not a bug — `/health` still returns 200.

## Known gotchas (already worked around in this repo)

- **`sharp` breaks the Workers bundle.** Next.js's built-in image optimizer references
  `sharp` (native binary) even with `images.unoptimized: true`. Fixed via a pnpm override
  pointing `sharp` at a tiny no-op stub (`tools/stubs/sharp/`, wired in the root
  `package.json`'s `pnpm.overrides`) — safe because neither app calls `next/image`.
- **`Dynamic require of ".../middleware-manifest.json" is not supported`.** A known
  opennextjs-cloudflare bug under pnpm's symlinked `node_modules`
  ([opennextjs-cloudflare#1232](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/issues/1232)).
  Worked around with `NEXT_PRIVATE_MINIMAL_MODE=1` in each frontend's `wrangler.jsonc`
  vars — disables Next.js middleware support, which neither app uses.
  Revisit if you ever add `middleware.ts`.
- **`wrangler deploy` crashes with `Error: write EOF` on Windows** when it auto-detects an
  OpenNext project and re-delegates to `opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` internally. Worked
  around by building first (`opennextjs-cloudflare build`) then deploying with
  `OPEN_NEXT_DEPLOY=true wrangler deploy`, which skips the auto-delegation (already
  wired into each app's `deploy` npm script... except the script itself calls
  `opennextjs-cloudflare build && wrangler deploy`, which still hits this on native
  Windows — WSL or CI/Linux runners don't have this problem).
- **`workerd` postinstall fails / `wrangler dev` doesn't work** on this Windows Server
  environment specifically (missing shared libs for the local runtime binary).
  `wrangler deploy` (real deploys) is unaffected — only local preview is.
